<p>ruby-2.2.5.tar.gzruby-2.2.5.tarruby-2.2.5ccanlicensesCC0</p>
<p>Statement of Purpose</p>
<p>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an &#8220;owner&#8221;) of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a &#8220;Work&#8221;).</p>
<p>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works (&#8220;Commons&#8221;) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.</p>
<p>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the &#8220;Affirmer&#8221;), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (&#8220;Copyright and Related Rights&#8221;). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:</li>
</ol>
<p>the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person&#8217;s image or likeness depicted in a Work;
rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer&#8217;s Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the &#8220;Waiver&#8221;). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer&#8217;s heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer&#8217;s express Statement of Purpose.</li>
<li>Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer&#8217;s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer&#8217;s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the &#8220;License&#8221;). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer&#8217;s express Statement of Purpose.</li>
<li>Limitations and Disclaimers.</li>
</ol>
<p>No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person&#8217;s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.</p>

<p>== Licence</p>
<p>This software is available under three licenses: the GNU GPL version 2 (or at
your option, a later version), the Perl Artistic license, or the MIT license.
Note that my preference for licensing is the MIT license, but the original Perl
MIME::Types was dually originally licensed with the Perl Artistic and the GNU
GPL (&#8220;the same terms as Perl itself&#8221;) and given that the Ruby implementation
hewed pretty closely to the Perl version, I must maintain the additional
licensing terms.</p>

<h1>A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE<a class="headerlink" href="#a-history-of-the-software" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cwi.nl">http://www.cwi.nl</a>) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python&#8217;s
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.</p>
<p>In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us">http://www.cnri.reston.va.us</a>)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.</p>
<p>In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zope.com">http://www.zope.com</a>).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/psf/">http://www.python.org/psf/</a>) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.</p>
<p>All Python releases are Open Source (see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opensource.org">http://www.opensource.org</a> for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.</p>

<p>Footnotes:</p>
<p>(1) GPL-compatible doesn&#8217;t mean that we&#8217;re distributing Python under
the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
other software that is released under the GPL; the others don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
CNRI, however, Stallman&#8217;s lawyer has told CNRI&#8217;s lawyer that 1.6.1
is &#8220;not incompatible&#8221; with the GPL.</p>
<p>Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido&#8217;s
direction to make these releases possible.</p>

<div>Preamble</div></blockquote>
<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</p>

</div></blockquote>
<p>freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software&#8211;to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation&#8217;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</div></blockquote>
<p>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div></blockquote>
<p>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</div></blockquote>
<p>gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</div></blockquote>
<p>(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Also, for each author&#8217;s protection and ours, we want to make certain</div></blockquote>
<p>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so

<p>patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free

<div>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div></blockquote>
<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="0">
<li>This License applies to any program or other work which contains</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The &#8220;Program&#8221;, below,
refers to any such program or work, and a &#8220;work based on the Program&#8221;
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term &#8220;modification&#8221;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &#8220;you&#8221;.</p>
<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#8217;s</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.</p>
<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
<p>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.</p>
<p>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.</p>
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
<p>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
<p>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.</p>
<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="6">
<li>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients&#8217; exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="7">
<li>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.</p>
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="8">
<li>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="9">
<li>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &#8220;any
later version&#8221;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="10">
<li>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>

<div><blockquote>
<div>NO WARRANTY</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="11">

<p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into

consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; SECTION 2: Artistic License, V2.0 &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Artistic License 2.0</p>
<p>Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.</p>
<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<p>Preamble
This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free software.</p>
<p>You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.</p>
<p>Definitions</p>
<p>&#8220;Copyright Holder&#8221; means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.</p>
<p>&#8220;Contributor&#8221; means any party that has contributed code or other material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder&#8217;s procedures.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8221; and &#8220;your&#8221; means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or modify the Package.</p>
<p>&#8220;Package&#8221; means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.</p>
<p>&#8220;Distribute&#8221; means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of your company or organization.</p>
<p>&#8220;Distributor Fee&#8221; means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does not mean licensing fees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Standard Version&#8221; refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Modified Version&#8221; means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Original License&#8221; means this Artistic License as Distributed with the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Source&#8221; form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration files for the Package.</p>
<p>&#8220;Compiled&#8221; form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source form.
Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.</li>
</ol>
<p>Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.</li>
<li>You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original License.</li>
</ol>
<p>Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source</p>
<p>(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of
the following:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.</li>
<li>ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version.</li>
<li>allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others under</li>
</ol>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li>the Original License or</li>
<li>a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions
without the Source</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.</li>
<li>You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the Modified Version.</li>
</ol>
<p>Aggregating or Linking the Package</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="7">
<li>You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.</li>
<li>You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.</li>
</ol>
<p>Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="9">
<li>Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.</li>
</ol>
<p>General Provisions</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="10">
<li>Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.</li>
<li>If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.</li>
<li>This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.</li>
<li>This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.</p>

<div><blockquote>
<div>Preamble</div></blockquote>
<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</p>
</div></blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software&#8211;to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some</div></blockquote>
<p>specially designated software packages&#8211;typically libraries&#8211;of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,</div></blockquote>
<p>not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div></blockquote>
<p>distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</div></blockquote>
<p>or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the</div></blockquote>
<p>library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that</div></blockquote>
<p>there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author&#8217;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of</div></blockquote>
<p>any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the</div></blockquote>
<p>ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using</div></blockquote>
<p>a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>We call this license the &#8220;Lesser&#8221; General Public License because it</div></blockquote>
<p>does Less to protect the user&#8217;s freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to</div></blockquote>
<p>encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free</div></blockquote>
<p>programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the</div></blockquote>
<p>users&#8217; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div></blockquote>
<p>modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
&#8220;work based on the library&#8221; and a &#8220;work that uses the library&#8221;.  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.</p>

<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>

</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called &#8220;this License&#8221;).
Each licensee is addressed as &#8220;you&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>A &#8220;library&#8221; means a collection of software functions and/or data</div></blockquote>
<p>prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The &#8220;Library&#8221;, below, refers to any such software library or work</div></blockquote>
<p>which has been distributed under these terms.  A &#8220;work based on the
Library&#8221; means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term &#8220;modification&#8221;.)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8220;Source code&#8221; for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div></blockquote>
<p>making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div></blockquote>
<p>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#8217;s</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,</div></blockquote>
<p>and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>The modified work must itself be a software library.</li>
</ol>
<p>b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
<p>c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</p>
<p>d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
in the event an application does not supply such function or
table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
its purpose remains meaningful.</p>
<p>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
application-supplied function or table used by this function must
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
root function must still compute square roots.)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.</p>
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.</p>
<blockquote>

<li>You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for</div></blockquote>
<p>that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of</div></blockquote>
<p>the Library into a program that is not a library.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy</div></blockquote>
<p>from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a &#8220;work that uses the Library&#8221;.  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>However, linking a &#8220;work that uses the Library&#8221; with the Library</div></blockquote>
<p>creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a &#8220;work that uses the
library&#8221;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>When a &#8220;work that uses the Library&#8221; uses material from a header file</div></blockquote>
<p>that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data</div></blockquote>
<p>structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may</div></blockquote>
<p>distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="6">
<li>As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>link a &#8220;work that uses the Library&#8221; with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer&#8217;s own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the</div></blockquote>
<p>Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><blockquote>
<div><p>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &#8220;work that
uses the Library&#8221;, as object code and/or source code, so that the
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
to use the modified definitions.)</p>
<p>b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
copy of the library already present on the user&#8217;s computer system,
rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</p>
<p>c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give the same user the materials
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
than the cost of performing this distribution.</p>
<p>d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
specified materials from the same place.</p>
<p>e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For an executable, the required form of the &#8220;work that uses the</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Library&#8221; must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license</div></blockquote>
<p>restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="7">
<li>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><blockquote>
<div><p>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
Sections above.</p>
<p>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="8">
<li>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="9">
<li>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="10">
<li>Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients&#8217; exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="11">
<li>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</p>
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.</p>
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="12">
<li>If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="13">
<li>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
&#8220;any later version&#8221;, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is

<p>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).</p>
<blockquote>
<div>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is</div></blockquote>
<p>safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
&#8220;copyright&#8221; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>

<blockquote>
<div>Preamble</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
reasonable modifications.</p>
<p>Definitions:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>&#8220;Package&#8221; refers to the collection of files distributed by the
Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
created through textual modification.</p>
<p>&#8220;Standard Version&#8221; refers to such a Package if it has not been
modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
of the Copyright Holder as specified below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Copyright Holder&#8221; is whoever is named in the copyright or
copyrights for the package.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8221; is you, if you&#8217;re thinking about copying or distributing
this Package.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reasonable copying fee&#8221; is whatever you can justify on the
basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
as a market that must bear the fee.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Freely Available&#8221; means that no fee is charged for the item
itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
under the same conditions they received it.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.</p>
<p>2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.</p>
<p>3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="2">
<li>use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.</li>
</ol>
<p>c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
documents how it differs from the Standard Version.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="4">
<li>make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
to get the Standard Version.</p>
<p>b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
the Package with your modifications.</p>
<p>c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="4">
<li>make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
product of your own.  You may embed this Package&#8217;s interpreter within
an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
interpreter is so embedded.</p>
<p>6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
Package via the so-called &#8220;undump&#8221; or &#8220;unexec&#8221; methods of producing a
binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
Package.</p>
<p>7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
regression tests for the language.</p>
<p>8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
when no overt attempt is made to make this Package&#8217;s interfaces visible
to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be
construed as a distribution of this Package.</p>
<p>9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.</p>
<p>10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &#8220;AS IS&#8221; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><blockquote>
<div>Preamble</div></blockquote>
<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p>software and other kinds of works.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed</div></blockquote>
<p>to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program&#8211;to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</div></blockquote>
<p>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you</div></blockquote>
<p>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</div></blockquote>
<p>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:</div></blockquote>
<p>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>For the developers&#8217; and authors&#8217; protection, the GPL clearly explains</div></blockquote>
<p>that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&#8217; and
authors&#8217; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run</div></blockquote>
<p>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users&#8217; freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.</div></blockquote>
<p>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>

<p>modification follow.</p>

</ol>
<p>&#8220;This License&#8221; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>
<p>&#8220;Copyright&#8221; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8220;The Program&#8221; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this</div></blockquote>
<p>License.  Each licensee is addressed as &#8220;you&#8221;.  &#8220;Licensees&#8221; and
&#8220;recipients&#8221; may be individuals or organizations.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>To &#8220;modify&#8221; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work</div></blockquote>
<p>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &#8220;modified version&#8221; of the
earlier work or a work &#8220;based on&#8221; the earlier work.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>A &#8220;covered work&#8221; means either the unmodified Program or a work based</div></blockquote>
<p>on the Program.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>To &#8220;propagate&#8221; a work means to do anything with it that, without</div></blockquote>
<p>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>To &#8220;convey&#8221; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other</div></blockquote>
<p>parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>An interactive user interface displays &#8220;Appropriate Legal Notices&#8221;</div></blockquote>
<p>to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>

<li>Source Code.</li>

<p>The &#8220;source code&#8221; for a work means the preferred form of the work</p>

<p>for making modifications to it.  &#8220;Object code&#8221; means any non-source
form of a work.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>A &#8220;Standard Interface&#8221; means an interface that either is an official</div></blockquote>
<p>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The &#8220;System Libraries&#8221; of an executable work include anything, other</div></blockquote>
<p>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
&#8220;Major Component&#8221;, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The &#8220;Corresponding Source&#8221; for a work in object code form means all</div></blockquote>
<p>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&#8217;s
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users</div></blockquote>
<p>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.</p>

<p>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not</div></blockquote>
<p>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>

<blockquote>
<div>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid</div></blockquote>
<p>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or

appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any

&#8220;keep intact all notices&#8221;.</p>
<p>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</p>
<p>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
work need not make them do so.</p>

&#8220;aggregate&#8221; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#8217;s users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.</p>

<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="6">
<li>Conveying Non-Source Forms.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><blockquote>
<div><p>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
customarily used for software interchange.</p>
<p>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</p>
<p>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
with subsection 6b.</p>
<p>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</p>
<p>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
charge under subsection 6d.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>A &#8220;User Product&#8221; is either (1) a &#8220;consumer product&#8221;, which means any</div></blockquote>
<p>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, &#8220;normally used&#8221; refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8220;Installation Information&#8221; for a User Product means any methods,</div></blockquote>
<p>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or</div></blockquote>
<p>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a</div></blockquote>
<p>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,</div></blockquote>
<p>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="7">
<li>Additional Terms.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#8220;Additional permissions&#8221; are terms that supplement the terms of this</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option</div></blockquote>
<p>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you</div></blockquote>
<p>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><blockquote>
<div><p>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</p>
<p>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
Notices displayed by works containing it; or</p>
<p>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</p>
<p>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
authors of the material; or</p>
<p>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</p>
<p>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
those licensors and authors.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &#8220;further</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>restrictions&#8221; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you</div></blockquote>
<p>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the</div></blockquote>
<p>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="8">
<li>Termination.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).</p>
<blockquote>
<div>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your</div></blockquote>
<p>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is</div></blockquote>
<p>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the</div></blockquote>
<p>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="9">
<li>Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</li>
</ol>
<p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="10">
<li>Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>An &#8220;entity transaction&#8221; is a transaction transferring control of an</div></blockquote>
<p>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party&#8217;s predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the</div></blockquote>
<p>rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>A &#8220;contributor&#8221; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this</p>

<p>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor&#8217;s &#8220;contributor version&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>A contributor&#8217;s &#8220;essential patent claims&#8221; are all patent claims</div></blockquote>
<p>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, &#8220;control&#8221; includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free</div></blockquote>
<p>patent license under the contributor&#8217;s essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>In the following three paragraphs, a &#8220;patent license&#8221; is any express</div></blockquote>
<p>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To &#8220;grant&#8221; such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,</div></blockquote>
<p>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  &#8220;Knowingly relying&#8221; means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient&#8217;s use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or</div></blockquote>
<p>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>A patent license is &#8220;discriminatory&#8221; if it does not include within</div></blockquote>
<p>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>

<div>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting</div></blockquote>

<p>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; SECTION 9: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Creative Commons Corporation (Creative Commons) is not a law firm and does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on as-is basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.</p>
<p>Using Creative Commons Public Licenses</p>
<p>Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.</p>
<p>Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.</p>
<p>Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensors permission is not necessary for any reason for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.</p>
<p>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License</p>
<p>By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (&#8220;Public License&#8221;). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Section 1  Definitions.</p>
<p>Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.
Adapter&#8217;s License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.
Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.</p>
<p>Section 2  Scope.</p>
<p>License grant.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
Downstream recipients.
Offer from the Licensor  Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).</p>
<p>Other rights.
Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.</p>
<p>Section 3 License Conditions.</p>
<p>Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.</p>
<p>Attribution.</p>
<p>If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:
identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
a copyright notice;
a notice that refers to this Public License;
a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;
indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter&#8217;s License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.</p>
<p>Section 4 Sui Generis Database Rights.</p>
<p>Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:</p>
<p>for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;
if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.</p>
<p>Section 5 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.</p>
<p>The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.</p>
<p>Section 6 Term and Termination.</p>
<p>This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.</p>
<p>Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.</p>
<p>Section 7  Other Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.</p>
<p>Section 8  Interpretation.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.
To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.</p>
<p>Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be considered the Licensor. Except for the limited purpose of indicating that material is shared under a Creative Commons public license or as otherwise permitted by the Creative Commons policies published at creativecommons.org/policies, Creative Commons does not authorize the use of the trademark Creative Commons or any other trademark or logo of Creative Commons without its prior written consent including, without limitation, in connection with any unauthorized modifications to any of its public licenses or any other arrangements, understandings, or agreements concerning use of licensed material. For the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph does not form part of the public licenses.</p>

<p>SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE</p>
<p>Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007</p>
<p>PREAMBLE</p>
<p>The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.</p>

The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>

<li>No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as presented to the users.</li>
<li>The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.</li>
<li>The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the Font Software.</li>
